abstract = {Context: The popularization of the use of Convolutional Neural Networks has created new challenges such as the use in embedded systems applications. Scientists, developers and organizations need to analyze the evolution of the field in industry and academia. Objective: To analyze the evolution of the area of Convolutional Neural Networks in industry and academia comparing the development between them. Methodology: A scientific mapping was conducted to analyze the scientific research in the field and a technological mapping was conducted to analyze the technological development in the field. Results: We identified 545 scientific papers and 33 patent applications. Conclusion: There is still a big difference between scientific development and technological development of the area, but the evolution of both is increasing.},
