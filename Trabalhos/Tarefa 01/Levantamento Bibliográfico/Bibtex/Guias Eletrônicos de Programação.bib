abstract = {This paper aims to provide architecture to create Electronic Program Guide applications that can be customized in real time. The Electronic Guide can be used not only as a stand alone application, but also as part of any other digital TV application. The proposed architecture was implemented having the support of the reference implementation of the Ginga middleware. Although specialized for the Brazilian Digital TV System and its declarative language, the architecture can be applied to generate computational code in different target-languages, with a clear separation among style, structure and navigational aspects of the Electronic Program Guide.},
