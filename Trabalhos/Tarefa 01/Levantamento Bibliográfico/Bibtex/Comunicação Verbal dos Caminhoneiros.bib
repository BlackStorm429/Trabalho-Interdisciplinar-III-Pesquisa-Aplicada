abstract = {Truck drivers, in their professional activity, often face stress conditions. Studies show that monitoring drivers' physiological signals can indicate undesirable situations such as fatigue, somnolence and stress, however, academic studies and commercial systems are still intrusive and prohibitively expensive. Prosody can be related to emotion; thus, audio communication between truck drivers and transportation operators can be monitored to detect stress conditions. This study aimed to identify stress applying Affective Computing and Machine Learning techniques in a audio corpus in Brazilian Portuguese, collected from truck drivers in their real work communication.},
