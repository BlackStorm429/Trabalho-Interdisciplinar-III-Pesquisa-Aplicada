  abstract={The teaching of Software Engineering usually occurs in computer courses through the traditional teaching approach, because the disciplines that present related content area, usually have a wide amount of theoretical topics, and that is why most teachers prefer to adopt this type of approach, causing demotivation and lack of engagement of students in the learning process. In order to use more effective strategies, the use of so-called "active teaching methodologies", such as Gamification, has been discussed in recent years. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze their effects on the behavior and learning of students, when used as a teaching strategy in disciplines that address related contents area. Therefore, this paper exposes how gamification was applied in two disciplines in the area of Software Engineering (Requirements Engineering and Software Analysis and Design) and what effects were generated in students' learning and behavior},
