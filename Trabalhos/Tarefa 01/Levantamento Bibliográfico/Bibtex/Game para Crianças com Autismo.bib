  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behavioral syndrome with different etiologies, deeply affecting the process of child development. Children with ASD have some characteristics in common such as the inability to relate to other people, leading to isolation, communication disorders and obsessive concern for what is unchanging. In addition, these people may experience learning difficulties in various contexts, such as school environment and daily activities. Given this scenario, how to raise the level of learning and reduce the isolation trends of autistic children? This paper presents a serious game focused on the teaching-learning of children with autism and attention deficit. Through a mobile device, they can find virtual 3D monsters that will be geographically spread around the world and, from their capture and interaction, learn the contents they offer. In addition, the game will allow interaction through virtual reality and augmented reality, so that the user feels motivated to use the application.},
