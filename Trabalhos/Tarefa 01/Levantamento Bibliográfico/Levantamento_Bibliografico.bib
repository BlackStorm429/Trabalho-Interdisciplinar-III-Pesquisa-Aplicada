abstract = {The teaching of Software Engineering usually occurs in computer courses through the traditional teaching approach, because the disciplines that present related content area, usually have a wide amount of theoretical topics, and that is why most teachers prefer to adopt this type of approach, causing demotivation and lack of engagement of students in the learning process. In order to use more effective strategies, the use of so-called "active teaching methodologies", such as Gamification, has been discussed in recent years. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze their effects on the behavior and learning of students, when used as a teaching strategy in disciplines that address related contents area. Therefore, this paper exposes how gamification was applied in two disciplines in the area of Software Engineering (Requirements Engineering and Software Analysis and Design) and what effects were generated in students' learning and behavior},

abstract = {Video encoder motion estimation algorithms allow a great level of parallelism exploitation, since the same arithmetic operations are repeated over near amounts of pixel data. This paper analyses the use of modern general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPU), such as the NVIDIA CUDA® as an effective acceleration engine to improve motion estimation algorithms overall performance. The results of our analysis include practical evaluations performed on different ME methods using CUDA platform. The evaluations show the impacts of the method, window search size, and ME thread mapping onto the GPGPU in the speed up that can be achieved in such parallel platform.},

The proposed architecture was implemented having the support of the reference implementation of the Ginga middleware. Although specialized for the Brazilian Digital TV System and its declarative language, the architecture can be applied to generate computational code in different target-languages, with a clear separation among style, structure and navigational aspects of the Electronic Program Guide.},

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behavioral syndrome with different etiologies, deeply affecting the process of child development. Children with ASD have some characteristics in common such as the inability to relate to other people, leading to isolation, communication disorders and obsessive concern for what is unchanging. In addition, these people may experience learning difficulties in various contexts, such as school environment and daily activities. Given this scenario, how to raise the level of learning and reduce the isolation trends of autistic children? This paper presents a serious game focused on the teaching-learning of children with autism and attention deficit. Through a mobile device, they can find virtual 3D monsters that will be geographically spread around the world and, from their capture and interaction, learn the contents they offer. In addition, the game will allow interaction through virtual reality and augmented reality, so that the user feels motivated to use the application.},

Studies show that monitoring drivers' physiological signals can indicate undesirable situations such as fatigue, somnolence and stress, however, academic studies and commercial systems are still intrusive and prohibitively expensive. Prosody can be related to emotion; thus, audio communication between truck drivers and transportation operators can be monitored to detect stress conditions. This study aimed to identify stress applying Affective Computing and Machine Learning techniques in a audio corpus in Brazilian Portuguese, collected from truck drivers in their real work communication.},

abstract = {O presente trabalho reflete, a partir do diálogo entre o Direito e a Engenharia de Software, acerca do atual paradigma de transparência pública, a fim de que os portais eletrônicos passem a produzir comunicação entre cidadãos e governos, e, por conseguinte, tornar materialmente possível o exercício do controle social. Assim, a problemática aqui enfrentada buscará responder de forma propositiva de que forma e através de quais mecanismos o diálogo entre os deveres de transparência pública e a engenharia de software pode contribuir para a produção de comunicação da Administração Pública com seus cidadãos para viabilizar o exercício do controle social, através dos portais de transparência. A hipótese trazida é a de que a partir do diálogo entre o direito e a engenharia de software, com utilização das linguagens de programação, técnicas de business intelligence, big data, machine learning, inteligência artificial aplicadas aos portais de transparências e aos dados em formato aberto disponibilizados pela Administração Pública, conforme determina a Lei de Acesso á Informação, possa-se viabilizar a comunicação entre cidadão e governo a partir do acesso possibilitado pelo advento da internet e o desenvolvimento de diversos instrumentos, tais como a compilação e produção de relatórios automatizados, tabelas, referências e acesso imediato a documentos e dados de natureza pública. Utilizou-se na presente pesquisa o método dialético. Por meio da utilização de dados disponibilizados pelo projeto Dados Abertos (https://dadosabertos.poa.br/), da capital Porto Alegre/RS, para o presente trabalho, foi realizada a extração dos dados referente às licitações e contratos administrativos (licitacon) realizados pelo mencionado ente público e disponibilizados em formato commaseparatedvalues - csv. Foi possível constatar 21.946 registros de licitações realizadas e produzir alguns gráficos que facilitam a compreensão dos dados. Além dos dados abertos, percebe-se necessária a estruturação e ampliação da própria administração pública brasileira através da engenharia de software, a partir daquilo que se denomina atualmente de governo digital.},

abstract = {Software accessibility evaluation for visually impaired people is strongly restricted to the Web platform. Many tools are able to automatically evaluate the accessibility degree of a website according to given Web accessibility guidelines. However, these guidelines are not sufficient to objectively evaluate the accessibility of any software product, including desktop and mobile platforms. On the other hand, the ISO/IEC 25000 standards, which provide a conceptual framework for quality specification and evaluation of software products, proposes measures that while providing some guidance on how to observe and measure aspects related to accessibility are relatively abstract. In this context, this work presents a systematic mapping study that tried to identify in the technical literature the attributes and measures of software accessibility for visually impaired people, take into account that visual impairment is the most frequent among people with some type of disability. Therefore, 14 attributes and 24 measures of software accessibility were identified in seven different papers. However, some of the identified accessibility attributes have subjective characteristics, leading to inaccurate measures. Among the identified measures, the majority refers to Web page resources, which may restrict their applicability to this kind of software.},

abstract = {Flood visualization plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting flood disasters, as it aids in the development of effective disaster mitigation measures and emergency response strategies. However, traditional methods of flood computation and visualization often suffer from poor timeliness and subpar visualization effects, particularly in virtual reality (VR) scenarios. Panoramic data, inherently suitable for VR visualization, offers a low data volume attribute that significantly reduces the time cost of data processing. This allows for the real-time overlay of flood simulation results with the actual environment. We proposed a multi-scale flood simulation method which is subsequently integrated with panoramic images or videos through a dimensionality reduction process, enhancing visualization effects. We developed a prototype system to validate the proposed methodology, and the results demonstrated improved visualization outcomes, rendering efficiency, and user experience in VR panoramic flood simulations.}
